Saturn's rings are made mostly of ice and rock, and some pieces are as small as grains of sand. Neutron stars are so dense that a teaspoon of their material would weigh about 6 billion tons on Earth. Black holes warp space and time so strongly that not even light can escape. Mercury has almost no atmosphere, which causes extreme temperature swings between day and night.

The Eiffel Tower was initially criticized by many Parisians but is now a global icon. The Code of Hammurabi is one of the oldest written legal codes. The Silk Road connected Asia and Europe, allowing trade of goods and culture for centuries. The first recorded female ruler was Pharaoh Sobekneferu of Egypt. Leonardo da Vinci not only painted the Mona Lisa but also designed early versions of helicopters and tanks. The first human flight in a hot-air balloon occurred in 1783 in France. The Great Fire of London in 1666 destroyed much of the city but led to major rebuilding and improved safety codes.",
    "The first programmable computer was invented by Konrad Zuse in 1936. The internet started as a project called ARPANET in the 1960s. The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. Smartphones combine computing, communication, and photography in one device. GPS satellites allow precise navigation anywhere on Earth. 3D printing can create objects layer by layer from digital designs. Artificial intelligence can now generate text, images, and even music. The first successful vaccine was developed by Edward Jenner in 1796 to fight smallpox. Electricity was harnessed for practical use by Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. The first powered flight by the Wright brothers occurred in 1903. Nuclear energy comes from splitting atoms in a process called fission. Quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Drones can be used for delivery, mapping, and even emergency medical aid. CRISPR technology allows precise editing of DNA to potentially cure genetic diseases.",
    "The Amazon rainforest produces about 20% of the world's oxygen. The average cloud weighs over a million tons. Volcanoes can create new land when lava cools and solidifies. The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the ocean, reaching nearly 36,000 feet. Coral reefs support about 25% of all marine species. Earth's magnetic field protects the planet from harmful solar radiation. Some deserts, like the Atacama, receive almost no rainfall for decades. Glaciers store about 69% of the world's freshwater. Lightning can reach temperatures five times hotter than the surface of the Sun. Ocean currents distribute heat around the planet, influencing climate and weather patterns. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on Earth. Bioluminescent organisms in the ocean produce light through chemical reactions. Trees can communicate with each other through underground networks of fungi. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates shift along faults. The ozone layer absorbs most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.",

Some metals, like sodium, explode on contact with water. A teaspoon of honey represents the entire lifetime work of a single bee. Cows have best friends and get stressed when separated. Dolphins use unique whistles as names to call each other. Humans glow faintly due to biochemical reactions, but our eyes cannot see it. Lightning can strike the same place multiple times in a row. Some frogs can survive being completely frozen and thaw alive in the spring.",
    "Humans tend to remember emotionally charged events better than neutral ones. Your brain can generate about 50,000 thoughts per day. People are more likely to conform to a group even when the group is wrong. The placebo effect can produce real physiological changes in the body. Multitasking reduces efficiency because the brain switches attention rather than doing tasks simultaneously. Humans have a negativity bias, which makes negative experiences more memorable than positive ones. Mirror neurons in the brain fire both when you act and when you observe someone else acting. People are more likely to help others when they are in a good mood. Memories are reconstructed, not replayed, which can make them inaccurate. Humans are naturally social and thrive in communities. Sleep is critical for memory consolidation and emotional regulation. People often overestimate how much others notice their mistakes, a phenomenon called the spotlight effect. Decision fatigue can make people choose poorly after making many choices. Humor can improve cognitive function and relieve stress. Music can trigger strong emotional responses and even change perception of time.",
    "Quantum entanglement allows particles to be connected instantly across vast distances. Light behaves both as a particle and a wave, a concept known as wave-particle duality. Superconductors can conduct electricity with zero resistance when cooled to very low temperatures. Lasers can concentrate light to cut through metal with precision. Time slows down for objects moving close to the speed of light, according to relativity. Black holes warp space and time so strongly that not even light can escape. Magnetic levitation can make trains float above tracks and move frictionlessly. 3D printing can now produce complex organs from living cells. Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity using photovoltaic cells. Artificial intelligence can now detect patterns in data far faster than humans.
